This is my Capstone Project.

This project was made as a passion project for Overwatch 2. My vision was to make a web service that makes the complicated task of looking for people to play Overwatch with. 
Players find themselves in a fast-paced space without the down-time to socialise and create bonds within the game. This platform offers the players a possible environment to seek out and connect with ideal players.
There currently is no other service that updates each user's Player information live using an API that taps into the player database from Overwatch.
